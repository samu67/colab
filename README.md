## Installation
To install all required packages:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get Started
The different methods are in the `methods` folder and just running them will get you started.

Code used in multiple places is placed in `common`.

All the data is in the `data` folder:
* **training** and the **validation** data set,
* the **test images** to make the predictions at the end,
* the **submission** files with the predictions
* tensorboard files (not in version control)



## Development

### Code Formatting
We use the uncompromising code formatter [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). 

To format: `$ black {source_file_or_directory}`
